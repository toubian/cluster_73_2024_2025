### your ta

Hi! I'm Sophia Toubian, a 2nd year PhD student in the Information Studies department. I was also at UCLA for undergrad (double bruin!!) studying Political Science and Society + Genetics. 

My research focuses on using network science to look at how we transmit and define "data". 

I was born in London and raised between the UK and Los Angeles, in my spare time I love to surf, climb, play basketball, and do pottery! (or if it's finals week: watch movies, reread Anne Carson, and eat too much mac and cheese) 

I'm really looking forwrd to getting to know you all better - don't hesitate to reach out, even to just ask abour campus or say hi! My email is **[toubian@ucla.edu](toubian@ucla.edu)**.

## __objectives__ 
Our objectives in section are as follows.

1. Cement lecture concepts
2. Expand on lecture concepts through discussion
3. Connect lecture concepts to each other through time + themes
4. Create community with one another to better serve objectives 1-3

## how section works

**We are a community of students finding our way at UCLA together.**  This means several things: 

  - **Structure**. Section will usually follow a loose schedule that will evolve over our time together. Generally it'll go something like this: 
  
    - Quiz: *20 min*
    
    - Lecture review + questions: *20 min*
    
    - Break: *10 min*
    
    - Close reading: *30 min*
    
    - Activity: *30 min*

  - **Our community produces more than the sum of its parts**. Every one of us is important in creating a well rounded perception of the content at hand. The more people participate in discussion, the stronger our collective understanding of the material. 
  
  - **We do exploratory research.**  This means that we don't always know why we are doing something at the outset. Trust your intuitions, because they are what we rely on to find out interesting things. Check in frequently and talk about what you are trying to do. 
  
  - **A pedagogical experiment**.  The goal is to develop your reading, writing, and speaking abilities - and to learn a set of skills that can be used in both academic and non-academic settings. 

 -  **Section is not secondary to lecture**.  Every section is important to your overall understanding of, and success in, the class. This is a yearlong commitment, and that includes discussion sections. 

 - **Everyone should add *and* take something, every single section**.  Make sure you're doing your best to add to the conversation and take a new thought away every time. tl;dr: *participate and pay attention*

 - **Every second together counts**.  Make the most of the time you have with your fellow students. An hour and 50 minutes may seem like a long time, but we've got a lot to fit in every week. Your peers are your greatest resource in expanding your understanding and ability to learn. 


## section guidelines

1. **If you are sick, heartbroken, or exhausted, come talk to me or one of your professors.** This work is not more important than your well being. This guideline works in tandem with the following guidelines on attendance and is also complementary to many of those that follow. Please communicate when you need support so that we can help you get it. 

For a list of UCLA Campus Resources for Student Support please see [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC9_vNrYTN9sylZM7HySeh21iTXRzwaUdBdo6_ngg00/edit?usp=sharing) as well as the other resources listed in the course syllabus.

2. **Attend Lecture and Section.** Lecture and section are the main ways that we operate as a community. Lecture meetings are where we learn the the values, concepts, goals, and ideas that drive our class, and therefore are where we work out how and why we work. Section allows us to interpret and understand those values, concepts, goals, and ideas personally. Without these meetings, we become disjointed and miss out on each others perspectives. If you are not going to make a discussion section or lecture, please [email](toubian@ucla.edu) me. 

3. **Respect others and their ideas**. We trust and depend on you to have meaningful discussions in section. Your TAs and Professors care for the class as a whole, while students care for the work, each other, and themselves. These discussions are integral to *everyone's* success in this cluster. When listening, respect your classmates by doing so quietly. Allow for them to express their ideas freely, and give them grace in explaining what they mean/think/feel. When speaking, do so with the intention of contributing positively to the discussion. Call upon course concepts and readings to help ground your ideas. Exploratory conversation is encouraged! Additionally, be cognizant of those who have not yet spoken if this is your 2nd+ time speaking in section. We are all learning from each other. The beauty of discussion section is that it is dedicated time for us to practice this learning. Give your classmates the benefit of the doubt, and when unsure *ask questions*. You are always welcome to check in with me, but you're here because you're smart and can figure things out so try that first. Mistakes will be made. That’s cool. We admit our mistakes and we communicate them to others so that mistakes aren't repeated and then we move on.

4. **Take care of each other, and yourself**. When you first start, work in groups so other classmates are there to answer questions or lend a hand. If you notice your classmates are struggling, provide whatever support you can, or tell someone that you think can help them. Listen to each other or respect each others desire for quiet when we need it. Students are always encouraged to speak their mind and communicate their concerns/questions. You can always bring me in to provide concrete support if you or another classmate requires it.

5. **Take breaks**! Studies have shown that taking regular breaks makes you more productive. It’s also important to care for yourself.

6. **Take your ideas seriously**. This class is structured partially around writing assignments that take what *you* think into direct account. Kindle those ideas! Write, read, discuss - do whatever you need to allow your voice to grow.
